    <div className="space-y-6 text-lg leading-relaxed dark:text-gray-300">
      <p>
        For countless ages, the bee kingdom and its creature, including bears, were living a peaceful life. The queen of this kingdom was Queen Beeatrice, a wise and fair ruler who ensured that every creature was treated with respect and lived in harmony. Everything was going fine until the bees began creating a new kind of purple honey, a curious substance that slowly disturbed the balance of the kingdom.
      </p>

      <p>
        While all loved its flavour at first, they soon noticed that something strange was happening, as anyone who ate it acted like a weird, aggressive, and mindless foe. The bees that were not affected were too weak to stop this chaos, but they noticed one thing: the bears were unharmed by purple honey. In a situation of fear and confusion, the bees attacked the bear village and locked them, hoping this would control the disaster.
      </p>

              className="w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg"
            />
          </div>

      <p>
        But somehow, one bear, whose name was Barren, managed to escape the attack, and now the fate of everyone rests on his shoulders. That's exactly where gameplay starts, where you play the character of Barren and explore the 3D open world. You have to solve the mystery of purple honey and rescue your friends and family from the cages. Throughout this adventure, you will face different enemies, from dangerous drones to deadly bosses. "The kingdom's hope lies in your paws."
